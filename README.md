# Pareto-Based Linter Front End

## What the Software Does & Its Purpose
The Pareto-Based Linter is a static code analysis tool that helps developers identify and address programming issues efficiently. It follows the Pareto principle (80/20 rule) to prioritize issues that have the most significant impact on code quality. This ensures that developers can focus on fixing the most critical issues first, improving maintainability and performance.

## Intended Market & Users
Python Programmers – Ensures code quality, readability, and adherence to best practices.

Students & Learners – Helps beginners understand coding conventions and avoid common mistakes.

Educators & Coding Instructors – Provides an automated way to evaluate students’ code and suggest improvements.

## Basic Functions
The linter scans the codebase and categorizes issues into five main levels:

Refactor – Suggests improvements to make the code more efficient, readable, and maintainable.

Convention – Ensures adherence to coding standards and best practices.

Warning – Flags potential issues that may lead to bugs or inefficiencies.

Error – Highlights definite problems that must be fixed for proper execution.

Fatal – Identifies critical issues that prevent the application from running correctly.

Siklab Senior High!

I would like to take my time to thank our professor, Sir Ralph Laurence Valdueza of his never-ending support. Without his help, this project is still possible. I want to thank Ashley Itorralba for her never ending reminders to submit my part on writing the research paper. I  would like to congratulate everyone who will pas their practical research with the help of our research paper. I would like to thank again Ashley Itorralba for guiding us. This project wouldn't be possible without her knowledge about the topic. That is all! I would to thank everyone who became part of my academic journey. That is all, thank you!
